          <h3>Who We Are</h3>
          <p>Dusty Books is your go to place for any and all secondhand literature. We are a site that specialises in collecting, cataloguing, and offering up for sale the vast number of secondhand books that exist in attics, basements, and musty shops all over Australia. While we don't claim to have everything, it is our goal to be able to help you find that rare, out of print, or just obscure book, that you have been searching for.</p>
          <p>It is also our goal to help you find an option to be able to clear out all of those books that having been gathering dust in the boxes at the back of your garages, the ones that you have read once and have no intention of ever reading again. Or those university text-books that simply become obsolete after you have finished the course and passed the exam.</p>

          <h3>Our History</h3>
          <p>Professor Hubert J Farnsworth (no relation) just could not find that particular book, no matter how hard he search, until he was in Armidale in Perth for some completely unknown reason, when he found it hidden away, at the back of a local secondhand bookshop. It was then that he came upon his idea - a way of connecting customers with books, and books with customers.</p>
          <p>He realised that many people only ever read their books once, and the second-hand bookshops simply were not able take everybody's unwanted literary works. Thus he created Dusty Books, a way for bookshops to reach out to customers who might never come anywhere their stores, and for the avid readers to be able to find that long lost book that just never seems to be anywhere, at least anywhere they happn to do.</p>

        <h3>Text Books</h3>
        <p>Do you think that text books are way overpriced. Do you dread that first day at university (or highschool) when you suddenly discover that you hip pocket (or that of your parents) has been hit with the cost of that book that your lecturer wrote and insists on using it over and over again. How about the case books that you need to complete your law degree? Well, we also have a vast collection of university text books sitting here gathering dust, waiting for you to purchase them at fire sale prices. In fact, we get so many every year that we have no choice but to send them to the recycling plant (because we are environmentally concious at Dusty Books). Have a look because who knows, you might be able to save yourselves $100.00 this semester (or you could just not by the books because as we all know, you never use them - unless you're studying law of course).</p>

        <h3>Audio books</h3>
        <p>Do you hate reading books. Well, you happen to be missing out on a whole world of adventure and romance because seriously, not everything makes it onto HBO. Are you peeved that Scy-Fy decided to cut another great series. Well, if you find yourself in a position where you simply do not have time to read books, or find that your morning communite to work involves squeezing into a sardine can that makes the Tokyo Subway look comfortable, you try our range of audio books. We have even got some greats who have agreed to read books out aloud, including Eddie Murphy, Richard Gere, Danial Craig (who delightfully agreed to do the entire James Bond collection), and of course Patrick Stewart doing both the X-men and Star Trek. And speaking of Patrick Stewart, are you one who believes that plays should be watched and not read, well we have the entire works of Shakespeare, Bernard Shaw, and some upstart from New York read not just by one, but multiple personalities all taking a different character.</p>
