                  <td>While I am familiar with some elements of webprogramming, particularly HTML, the only actual experience that I have had has been in regards to a <a href="http://www.sarkology.net/search/label/Games" target="_blank"> Blogger</a> and a <a href="http://www.sarkologytravels.net" target="_blank">Wordpress site</a> which allows some editing using HTML. I did play around with html back in the very, very early days of the internet, but that website has well and truly disappeared.</td>

                <th>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</th>
                <td>As you can probably see from my blogs, my ability to be able to design nice fancy webpages is bordering on non-existance. While I appreciate art, I am not an artist. As such, my strengths tend to lie more in the backend and as such am more interested in the programming side of software development.</td>

                <th>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</th>
                <td>Well, Web Programming is compulsory, so I really didn't have much of a choice. However, after working in the Finance industry for the last thirteen odd years I simply got to a point that I really needed a break, and a career change, so I decided that I'd pursue something that I had been interested in (computers) since I was a kid, but never studied it during my first time at university.</td>

                <td>I guess a piece of paper that tells potential employers that I know a thing or two about using a computer. Actually, I'd like to know more about operating computers beyond entering text into text fields, answering emails, and watching train videos on Youtube (as well as uploading them).

                <td>Honestly, I'm not that much of a designer. My strengths tend to lie more in the way of backend programming, as well as content creation. In relation to paired work, it would be great to work with somebody who has some artistic flair (though I am not expecting an Renoir).</td>

                  <ul>
                      <li><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>: I love books, and this is a site dedicated to books.</li>
                      <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank">IMDB</a>: I like my movies as well.</li>
                      <li><a href="http://www.readingcinemas.com/" target="_blank">Reading Cinemas</a>: Just so I know what movies happen to be on at my local cinema.</li>
                      <li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>: This site has saved me from getting lost so many times.</li>
                      <li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank">Yelp</a>: This is like Trip Advisor on steriods. I just love the community aspect, something that many review sites lack.</li>
                      <li>Blogger (and Wordpress): I love writing.</li>
                      <li><a href="=https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube</a>: I can't forget this site. I don't know how many hours I have wasted here. I even have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0K_XasnQVQun9V6M0jYYnQ?view_as=subscriber" target="_blank">a channel</a>, if you like watching trains that is.</li>

                <td>I could say sitting at home watching train videos on YouTube but that would make me sound boring. I could also say riding horses and archery, but I've only ever ridden one horse in my life, and while I have shot arrows at targets in the past, I would hardly say I am any good at it. So, I'll just say that I like reading (science fiction, and the classics), exploring, and fiddling with electronics, or at least trying to make some time where I can sit down and start fiddling with electronics. Oh, and I also really enjoy writing.</td>
