This code is for the webpage that formed the three assignments for my Web Programming course.
A2 is written using Javascript, HTML and CSS which A3 has been written using PHP, as well as the aformentioned scripts.
The site is supposed to be a second hand bookshop, and covers displaying a list of products, a single product, and the basic
platform for placing an order.
